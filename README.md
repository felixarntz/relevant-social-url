# Relevant Tweet

This plugin adds a field to the WordPress editor sidebar which allows you to paste the URL to a tweet that is associated with the post. The URL is then stored in post meta and can be used to e.g. display the relevant tweet URL in the frontend.

By default, the plugin will append the link to the post content in the frontend. This can be disabled via filter though in favor of manual output elsewhere.
